//NOTE!!!
//Now, here's an important question. Are you a slick modern coder, or are you stuffed up the north end of a south-bound camel?
//old school javascript coders use a Java style syntax and camel case everything. You are an enlightend Ruby coder who has
//realised that CamelCased variables are harder to read than nice under_scored variables.  So... do you name that method justAMethod or just_a_method?  
//It's a matter of taste, but I think it makes sense from a readability point of view and when you're switching back and forth between ruby.
//In all javascript that I'll show you, I will be using the underscore style! deal_with_it
